However, the term Internet actually refers to the global network of servers that makes the information sharing that happens over the Web possible. So, although the Web does make up a large portion of the Internet, but they are not one and same.",

      "body": "ReactJS is a component-based library where components make our code reusable and split our UI into different pieces.
